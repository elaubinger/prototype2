<p><b>Pitch Doc: The Fantastic Abyss</b></p>

<p><b>High Concept:</b><br />
Final Fantasy Tactics-like combat in a Roguelike dungeon. Players control a team of warriors as they descend into the ever-growing challenge beneath.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><b>Genre:</b></p>

<p>Turn-based strategy RPG. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><b>Gameplay:</b></p>

<p>Players outfit a party with RPG style equipment (weapons, armor, gadgets) in between turn based encounters. The turn based battles are controlled in a Final Fantasy Tactics-like style with each character taking a turn in order. The player controls characters in their party and uses a variety of combat styles to overcome enemies and traps.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><b>Features:</b></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Turn based RPG combat</p>

</li>
<li><p>Randomized dungeons and enemies</p>

</li>
<li><p>Large amount of customization</p>

</li>
<li><p>Strategic depth</p>

</li>
<li><p>Generous variety</p>

</li>
<li><p>Replayability</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><b>Setting:</b></p>

<p>A large town surrounds the labyrinth, whose deepest depths have never been seen. Many come from far and wide to explore it's inner reaches; however, few possess the courage to strike deep into the maze. Red banners fly and trumpets sound heralding the arrival of a new party plunging to their almost certain doom: perhaps they are the King's men on a holy mission, or prisoners sentenced to death, or perhaps something even more bizarre. Whatever the case, the abyss makes all equal in the end.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><b>Story:</b></p>

<p>The loose story as referenced in the setting is you command a party of adventurers attempting to crawl as deep as possible into a mysterious, seemingly endless dungeon.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><b>Target Audience:</b></p>

<p>Hardcore computer enthusiasts.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><b>Hardware Platforms:</b></p>

<p>PC in Javascript/Phaser</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><b>Estimated Schedule:</b></p>

<p>2 Weeks for a Gameplay prototype</p>

<p>2 Weeks for dungeon/weapon generation prototype</p>

<p>1-2 Weeks for simple enemy prototypes</p>

<p>1 Week for integration</p>

<p><b>Summary:</b></p>

<p>Tactics games are enormous fun as are Roguelike games. This pairing of the two would see the best parts of customization, choice, and random-elements from Roguelike games pair with the strategic depth, planning, and multiple-characters of a tactics game to form something different while preserving the best parts of both.</p>
